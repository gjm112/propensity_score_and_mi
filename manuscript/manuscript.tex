\begin{abstract}
In sports, an aging curve depicts the relationship between average
performance and age in athletes' careers. This paper investigates the
aging curves for offensive players in the Major League Baseball. We
study this problem in a missing data context and account for different
types of dropouts of baseball players during their careers. In
particular, the performance metrics associated with the missing seasons
are imputed using a multiple imputation model for multilevel data, and
the aging curves are constructed based on the imputed datasets. We first
perform a simulation study to evaluate the effects of different dropout
mechanisms on the estimation of aging curves. Our method is then
illustrated with analyses of MLB player data from past seasons. Results
suggest an overestimation of the aging curves constructed without
imputing the unobserved seasons, whereas a better estimate is achieved
with our approach.
